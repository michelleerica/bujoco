## Background
The Bullet Journal Collective takes some of the guess work out of the bullet journal formatting.

But first...

*What is Bullet Journal?*
As explained by [lifehacker.com](https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2016/09/the-bullet-journal-minus-the-hype-is-actually-a-really-good-planner/),
a bullet journal is a notebook that accommodates a huge variety of planning schemes. You can create calendars and to-do lists, and you can also use it as a diary, a brainstorming notepad, and more. If you've ever bought a planner, but didn't love the design of the pre-printed pages, the bullet journal is your opportunity to make a planner that fits the way your brain works.

The beauty (and the curse) of this hand-written calendar, is that you create it as you go, so you always have space for everything else you want to write.

*What is the Bullet Journal Collective?*
When I first started bullet journalling, I had a couple of problems:
* I had no idea where to start
* I wasted a lot of time (and paper) hand drawing templates
* I found lots of great resources scattered across the interwebs.

In an attempt to solve these problems, I made the Bullet Journal Collective.

The basic premise is to help new users play with layout without having to hand draw each iteration out.

Once a user starts designing, they can save their creation (and return to it later to continue to edit) or if they're happy with the content, they can publish their design and share with others. Users can also save their designs down to their desktop at any point in time prior to publication.

Lessons learned / wins
  * Interrelationship between front-end and back-end web development, particularly how to send information between the two ends.
  * When I started the project, I didn't appreciate how back-end heavy my project needed to be for it to have the functionality I wanted, so in a way, I tricked myself into doing a full stack web app instead of the front end-y project I had initially intended on creating. Lack of foresight aside, I'm really happy it worked out this way. As a result, I learnt a LOT about full stack web development, and brought together the knowledge I've gained over the 12 weeks of my GA Web Development Immersive experience.
