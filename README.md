## Background
The Bullet Journal Collective takes some of the guess work out of the bullet journal formatting.

But first...

*What is Bullet Journal?*
As explained by [lifehacker.com](https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2016/09/the-bullet-journal-minus-the-hype-is-actually-a-really-good-planner/),
a bullet journal is a notebook that accommodates a huge variety of planning schemes. You can create calendars and to-do lists, and you can also use it as a diary, a brainstorming notepad, and more. If you've ever bought a planner, but didn't love the design of the pre-printed pages, the bullet journal is your opportunity to make a planner that fits the way your brain works.

The beauty (and the curse) of this hand-written calendar, is that you create it as you go, so you always have space for everything else you want to write.

*What is the Bullet Journal Collective?*
When I first started bullet journalling, I had a couple of problems:
* I had no idea where to start
* I wasted a lot of time (and paper) hand drawing templates
* I found lots of great resources scattered across the interwebs.

In an attempt to solve these problems, I made the Bullet Journal Collective.

The basic premise is to help new bullet journallers play with layout without having to hand draw each iteration out.

Once a user starts designing, they can save their creation (and return to it later to continue to edit) or if they're happy with the content, they can publish their design and share with others. Users can also save their designs down to their desktop at any point prior to publication.

Features
  Users can:
* create and edit designs on a canvas using the supplied hand-drawn flourishes on the left hand toolbar of flourishes (hand drawn by Felicity Lee and me).

* publish their designs for future reference
* access other users' published designs


Future releases
  * Users to be able to upload their own flourishes

Lessons learned
  * Interrelationship between front-end and back-end web development, particularly how to send information between the two ends.
  * The importance of having a clear vision and allowing ideas to evolve once the basic product is developed.
  * UX considerations when developing an idea.
